Form Validation Using JavaScript
This project demonstrates how to implement form validation using JavaScript. The goal is to create a contact form with validation for name, email, phone number, and message fields.

Project Overview:
Set up a basic HTML contact form.
Implement JavaScript code to validate input fields.
Ensure that the form collects accurate and properly formatted data.

Key Steps:
HTML Setup: Create an HTML file with a contact form structure.
JavaScript Implementation: Write JavaScript functions to validate input fields.
Name Validation: Verify that the name field is not empty and contains only alphabetic characters.
Email Validation: Check if the email field is not empty and has a valid email format.
Phone Number Validation: Validate the phone number field to ensure it contains only numbers and meets the required length.
Message Validation: Ensure that the message field is not empty and has a maximum character limit.
Error Handling: Display appropriate error messages if any input fails validation.
Submission Handling: Handle form submission after successful validation.

Usage:

Clone or download the repository.
Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the contact form.
Fill in the form fields and observe the validation process.
Submit the form to see the validation in action.
