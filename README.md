Implement JavaScript code to validate input fields.
Ensure that the form collects accurate and properly formatted data.

# Key Steps:

### Name Validation: 
- Verify that the name field is not empty and contains only alphabetic characters.
### Email Validation: 
- Check if the email field is not empty and has a valid email format.
### Phone Number Validation: 
- Validate the phone number field to ensure it contains only numbers and meets the required length.
### Message Validation: 
- Ensure that the message field is not empty and has a maximum character limit.
### Error Handling:
- Display appropriate error messages if any input fails validation.
### Submission Handling: 
- Handle form submission after successful validation.

## Usage:
